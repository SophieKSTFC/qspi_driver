# QSPI Driver

QSPI Driver is a command line tool, compiled for ARM architecture, that enables reading, erasing and programming the four flash memory devices on board the FEM-II module through the QSPI controller. The flash memories can be programmed from a provided .bin file. The flash memories can equally be read out and the data stored in a .bin file. The tool provides verification of the flash memory program operation using a CRC-8.
